I don't want to wake up tomorrow.  
Not like I don't want to live,  
I don't.  
But this is different.  

I don't want to wake up tomorrow;  
Without your good night message to read,  
Without a good morning message to send to you,  
Without a random Reel you sent at midnight,  
Without anything to look forward to.  

I don't want to wake up tomorrow  
without you.
